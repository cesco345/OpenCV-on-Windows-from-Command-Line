# OpenCV-on-Windows-from-Command-Line
This is a repository that will hold all the files and tutorial information for running OpenCV on a native C++ Windows-based Command Prompt

A lot of us prefer to do our OpenCV applications on a Linux environment, where we can take advanvtage of the free Gcc and G++ compilers, and it seems to work seamlessly.
This repository and tutorials is for those people that for any given reason have to do their work on a Windows-based environment. Is not as easy to use the tools that are freely available in the Linux world, e.g., compilers, libraries, toolchains, and so on. In here I will show you how you can use freely available tools where you can get very close to a linux command line environment.
